# 😛 Fancy Counter App

Welcome to Fancy Counter App! This is a ReactJS application that allows you to count from 0 to 5 with a fancy interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Decrement count with the "-" button
- Reset count to 0 with the "Reset" button
- Limitation: Counting is restricted to a maximum value of 5
- Ability to use the spacebar on the keyboard for counting

## ⚡️ Main Technologies

- Vite
- React.js

### 🤔 How It Works

The app is built with ReactJS, utilizing modern React hooks for state management and side effects.

- **useState**: The `useState` hook is used to manage the count state within the application. It allows us to declare state variables directly in functional components.

- **useEffect**: The `useEffect` hook is employed to handle keyboard events for counting with the spacebar. It enables us to perform side effects in functional components, such as subscribing to events, without directly using lifecycle methods.

The counting functionality is limited to a maximum value of 5, ensuring a seamless user experience.
